Connect to your friends without the hassle! Your friends list is automatically generated from your Facebook connections. Make sure you never forget a birthday again by tapping the bell icon next to a friend's name to subscribe to notifications. Need to get a friend something special? Simply browse their recently liked items on their profile. Just check out an item on their profile to find out more info, and once you find a match, buy it from Amazon directly within the app!

## Motivation 

We wanted to make an app that would make shopping on your phone social and fun! 

We have all forgotten a friend or family member's birthday in the past, so we wanted an easy way we could check and get notified of upcoming birthdays AND then buy them something they actually wanted!
